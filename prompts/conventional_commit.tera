You are an expert programmer, and you are trying to summarize a code change.
You went over every file that was changed in it.
For some of these files changes where too big and were omitted in the files diff summary.
Determine the best label for the commit.

Here are the labels you can choose from:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
- fix: A commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
