A git prepare-commit-msg hook for authoring commit messages with GPT-3. With this tool, you can easily generate clear, comprehensive and descriptive commit messages letting you focus on writing code.

See [announcement blog post](https://zura.wiki/post/never-write-a-commit-message-again-with-the-help-of-gpt-3/).

## Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/552380.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/552380)

## Installation

1. Install this tool locally with `cargo` (recommended).

```sh
cargo install --locked gptcommit
```

or on macOS, use homebrew

```sh
brew install zurawiki/brews/gptcommit
```

2. In your `git` repository, run the following command to install `gptcommit` as a git prepare-commit-msg hook. You will need to provide an OpenAI API key to complete the installation.

```
gptcommit install
```

## Usage

To use `gptcommit`, simply run `git commit` as you normally would. The hook will automatically generate a commit message for you using GPT-3. If you're not satisfied with the generated message, you can always edit it before committing.

Note: By default, `gptcommit` uses the GPT-3 model. Please ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account to use it.

**n.b.** If your OpenAI API key has changed, simply re-run `gptcommit install`.

## Features

`gptcommit` supports a number of configuration options that are read from `$HOME/.config/gptcommit/config.toml`.
Configs are applied in the following order:

- User settings as read from `$HOME/.config/gptcommit/config.toml`.
- Environment variables starting with `GPTCOMMIT__*`.

### Set your OpenAI API key

Persist your OpenAI key

```sh
gptcommit config set openai.api_key sk-...
```

You can also config this setting via the `GPTCOMMIT__OPENAI__API_KEY`.

To maintain compatibility with other OpenAI clients, we support the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables. This will take the highest precedence.

### Try out a different OpenAI model

`gptcommit` uses `text-davinci-003` by default. The model can be configured to use other models as below

```sh
gptcommit config set openai.model text-davinci-002
```

You can also config this setting via the `GPTCOMMIT__OPENAI__MODEL`.

For a list of public OpenAI models, checkout the [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview). You can also bring in your own fine-tuned model.
